/* AUTOMATIC SYNC OF ANOTHER VERSION'S AUDIO (owner, 07/11: "Match
 * automatically", on click only). Pure part: no FFmpeg, no threads.
 *
 * A dub or a voice-over keeps the original's music and effects; only the
 * speech differs. Both audios become energy envelopes (one value per 10 ms)
 * in four bands (all, low, speech, high: the low and high bands carry the
 * music and effects a dub keeps), then onset curves (rises of the log
 * energy, which hits, cuts and music share), and the offset is the lag where
 * the curves correlate best, searched around a centre. The result is only
 * taken when its peak is clearly above the next best one: otherwise the sync
 * stays manual.
 *
 * Mapping: this file's time = other version's time * ratio + offset. ratio 1
 * is the same speed; 25/23.976 a PAL version (sped up 4 %). */
